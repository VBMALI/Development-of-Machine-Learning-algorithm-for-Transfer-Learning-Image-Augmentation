# Development-of-Machine-Learning-algorithm-for-Transfer-Learning-Image-Augmentation
- This Project aims at developing a framework for transfer learning and image augmentation using keras. This project walks through the methodology on how augmentation is applied to machine learning data set and shows an example. 
- This project also demonstrates the approach for transfer learning started with pre-trained network as feature layer which is used with the output layer of classification problem. There are two different pre-trained networks are used and the performance of both in terms of the results is compared.

Technologies Used:
  - 
  - Language: Python
